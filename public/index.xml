      <description>The „Floating pointers“ project exists in 4 versions, 3 of which have been already presented in different venues in Salzburg (A), Graz (B), and Eckernförde (C) (Provinzlärm Festival).
Version A explores the human-computer interaction methods with the dancer’s complete control of the sound medium, version B is focused on the human-to-human interaction as an alternative interpretation of the same computer music instruments. Version C combines both approaches and invites the audience to compare the beautiful and completely different results.</description>

      <description>“Grow” combines dance in the limited space of the beamer’s projection with the visual art, operated in real time, and live electronic music, synthesised and played live.
The piece explores the transformative relationships between the body and technology. The reaction-interactions chains between the dancer and composer/multimedia artist are the result of nonverbal communication. Visually the role of the dancer is to propose the movement sequences, which receive immediate reactions in music and/or visual content because of the active visual following, or vice versa - the dancer reacts on the sound sequence, proposed by the composer in real time.</description>

      <description>Live performance with the active motion-tracking system, where the dancer interacts with the invisible objects and fully controls the sound.
Flashback into the space, where everything is questionably existing in the personal emotional relations with the memory-carrier. The memories come and go not always as expected, forcing the carrier to live them shortly again. There is no evidence how the memories are connected. The reality after flashback is not perceived in the same way.</description>

      <description>if the ecosystem of trees’ communication could be magnified, what would it sound like? which would be these trees’ own interpretations and how would the processing of the incoming information sound like? The installation explores the trees-network concept, as well as anthropogenic influences on the ecosystemic cycle.
Live-electronics sound installation for 20 audio channels.
Installation exists in 2 versions: using small loudspeakers (v.0) and using plexiglass (v.1).

      <description>„The ocean I am“ is a subjectively described collective consciousness, formed by the texts by Maria Kalesnikawa (Belorussian activist) and Vasyl Stus (Ukrainian poet), written in the prisons. These voices (partly unheard, interpreted by Viktoria Vitrenko) are ones of thousands wrongly convicted and sentenced people of todays regimes and ongoing war.

      <description>Live electronic music, live visual art, dance in front of the video projection.
Alexander von Humboldt (1769- 1859) is a german geographer, naturalist, explorer and the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change, in 1800 and again in 1831, based on observations generated during his travels. How could he react on the climate changes today? In the piece „a letter to Humboldt“ we want to pay people’s attention to the beauty and at the same time vulnerability of the nature.</description>

      <description>This project explores the feedback connection between the inner and outer.
Initially planned as a project for 2 dancers and a e-violin performer (version 1), producing an effect on each other during the performance, because of the COVID-19 restrictions project has the live instrumental component. Currently project exists in 4 versions. Version 1 explores the 3 elementary living forms, coexisting and sharing the multimedia and physical spaces. Version 1 (inner) A is connecting the oscillations of one dancer between the inner and outer worlds as seen from the perspective of another dancer.</description>

      <description>Game-assisted live-electronics composition
„Springing“ is a piece for one computer music performer and a stereo output. The initial idea was springs with which you can interact without hearing the acoustic result of that interaction except a synthesised one. This spring should be treated metaphorically as a magnetic tape from the old analog tape machines with the writing and reading heads. This invisible spring should exist within the constraints of a virtual physics system (implemented within the Unity game engine ) and be accessible for interaction with the help of the Optitrack motion capture system (version 2) or NanoKontrol interface (version 1) .</description>

      <description>Live electronic music , live visual art, dance in front of the video projection.
In the project “U-92” we make an artistic exploration in the field of interactive space with transformational reactions on chemical processes of uranium. Our Society uses this diverse element with good intention (nuclear-medicine) or for demonstrating power (weapons). Another problematic subject is its inexhaustible resource of energy, which we are producing (nuclear reactor) in a careless way.</description>

      <description>An experience inspired by water, nigh dreams and how we can experience these in a disembodied space, together. One main hubs room leads to three others, loosely inspired by the following words: &amp;ldquo;one can never step in the same river twice&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;what water will bring, will be taken away by water again,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;from water to air, holding and suspending, and then releasing and surfacing.

      <description>„Surface studies“ is a series of compositions for 1-4 computer-music performers. It explores the physical touch of the electrically conductive parts of the hybridised score-instrument. The main sonic idea is based on a simple statement, that with the bare hands, one could share the body’s electrical properties to the auditory domain. The visual design of the score-instrument combines the affordances of the conductive paint with the drawn sound approach. The score-instrument is created as a visual art form in the relation to the graphic score concept.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Communication is possible: Bartok-Berio&amp;rdquo; is a combination of duets from two cycles of short pieces for two violins by composers Luciano Berio and Bela Bartok.
Live electronics and sound processing change the ways music material by Berio and Bartok is unfolding. Transition pieces between Berio and Bartok duets, composed by Alisa Kobzar, create the intonational and figurative bridges between the musical languages of Bartok and Berio.

„S“ is short for Sanbiki no saru. Sanbiki no saru (literally “three monkeys”), sometimes called the three mystic apes, are a pictorial maxim. Together they embody the proverbial principle “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil”. The three monkeys are Mizaru, covering his eyes, who sees no evil; Kikazaru, covering his ears, who hears no evil; and Iwazaru, covering his mouth, who speaks no evil.</description>
