for 3 female voices

„S“ is short for Sanbiki no saru. Sanbiki no saru (literally “three monkeys”), sometimes called the three mystic apes, are a pictorial maxim. Together they embody the proverbial principle “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil”. The three monkeys are Mizaru, covering his eyes, who sees no evil; Kikazaru, covering his ears, who hears no evil; and Iwazaru, covering his mouth, who speaks no evil. For me, this symbol means the desire to achieve inner and outer harmony state. All three voices are considered to be a unified sound-stream with periodical highlighting of the musical sounds, phrases, and motives.
