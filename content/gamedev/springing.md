Game-assisted live-electronics composition

„Springing“ is a piece for one computer music performer and a stereo output.
The initial idea was springs with which you can interact without hearing the acoustic result of that interaction except a synthesised one.
This spring should be treated metaphorically as a magnetic tape from the old analog tape machines with the writing and reading heads. This invisible spring should exist within the constraints of a virtual physics system (implemented within the Unity game engine ) and be accessible for interaction with the help of the Optitrack motion capture system (version 2) or NanoKontrol interface (version 1) . The rigid bodies - retro-reflective marker-based assets - should be used as a real-world tools to interact with those invisible springs.
The sound source, placed „on“ each spring, is an audio recording stretched evenly along the spring’s length and respectively panned in the corresponding speaker pair.

Part "Flow" of the version 1, explored by Sinan Samanli.
