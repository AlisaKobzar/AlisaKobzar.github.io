Game prototype.
Protagonist: Maria Kalesnikawa (contemporary flautist, imprisoned Belorussian activist), who goes in a night dream (nightmare - achieved with the help of various visual glitches, which confuse the player's navigation) through the stages of her life (labyrinth ) in reverse from now until the point, when she decided, that the political future of her country is more important than her successful musical career.
The goal of the game is to find the protagonist's lost voice.

Collaboration with Taya Kabaeva (visual design)
