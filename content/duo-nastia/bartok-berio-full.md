"Communication is possible: Bartok-Berio" is a combination of duets from two cycles of short pieces for two violins by composers Luciano Berio and Bela Bartok.

Live electronics and sound processing change the ways music material by Berio and Bartok is unfolding.
Transition pieces between Berio and Bartok duets, composed by Alisa Kobzar, create the intonational and figurative bridges between the musical languages of Bartok and Berio.
