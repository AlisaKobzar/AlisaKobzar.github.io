**Artist's statement**

I’m a composer and a multimedia artist. I create audio-visual structures, whether fixed pieces, live performances, or installations. 

I treat sound, moving pictures and the human body as a single versatile meta-instrument. My art is a multilayered complementarity of many components from different media. Creating connections, correspondences, translations and traces of those components across the media fascinates me. 
Composing is a way of learning for me - I learn my envisioned constructions, treated as artworks, as well as learn myself. 
Inspired by the sciences and linguistics, I’m constructing my artwork as a living system, folding my emotional attitudes to its subjects inside of living structural connections. 

I want the audience to make their discoveries through the experiencing process of my artworks.
