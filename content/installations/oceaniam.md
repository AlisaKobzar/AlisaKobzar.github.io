„The ocean I am“ is a subjectively described collective consciousness, formed by the texts by Maria Kalesnikawa (Belorussian activist) and Vasyl Stus (Ukrainian poet), written in the prisons. These voices (partly unheard, interpreted by Viktoria Vitrenko) are ones of thousands wrongly convicted and sentenced people of todays regimes and ongoing war.
