if the ecosystem of trees’ communication could be magnified, what would it sound like? which would be these trees’ own interpretations and how would the processing of the incoming information sound like? The installation explores the trees-network concept, as well as anthropogenic influences on the ecosystemic cycle. 

Live-electronics sound installation for 20 audio channels.

Installation exists in 2 versions: using small loudspeakers (v.0) and using plexiglass (v.1).
