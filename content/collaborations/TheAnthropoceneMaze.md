`role: composer, developer`

An interactive sound environment on the topic of the anthropocene is created using an interactive floor equipped with Pyzoflex® technology by Joanneum Research that registers any change in pressure on its surface, combined with an Ambisonics audio environment.
Footstep sounds of a person walking on the floor are modified in real time, within a virtual soundscape based on the ambiance of different habitats’ soundscapes. The story is following a narrative, where a future computer travel guide leads a tour into the past — which really is our present, and shows that the habitats suffering from human influence. The floor can be seen as a metaphor for the ecological footprint of humankind.
