`rotkäppchen duo` is an Austria-based collaboration between the multimedia artist Alisa Kobzar and the dancer and choreographer Lisa Mc Guire. Since 2019 they are creating art projects together and performing in Vienna, Graz, Salzburg, as well as via live stream to Hong Kong. rotkäppchen has been part of concerts (Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics  concerts, Kunsthaus Graz), multimedia exhibitions (Pointlessness), conferences (Audio Mostly, DACA) and also produced their own performances (TIK, Sargfabrik, etc.), also duo collaborates with the local schools for creating the multimedia performances and educational events for and with kids. The basis of their work is formed by non-verbal communication between dance, music and visuals. For each piece they create a specific communication-reaction chain, which allows them to naturally include sound, visual and movement improvisations into the live performance. They experiment with motion tracking and sensor systems, immersive audio solutions and live video projection.
