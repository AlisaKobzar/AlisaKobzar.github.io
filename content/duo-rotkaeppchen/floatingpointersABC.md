The „Floating pointers“ project exists in 4 versions, 3 of which have been already presented in different venues in Salzburg (A), Graz (B), and Eckernförde (C) (Provinzlärm Festival).

Version A explores the human-computer interaction methods with the dancer’s complete control of the sound medium, version B is focused on the human-to-human interaction as an alternative interpretation of the same computer music instruments. Version C combines both approaches and invites the audience to compare the beautiful and completely different results.

„Floating pointers“ (ver. A, B, C) is a realtime multimedia project for a dancer and live quadrophonic electronic music. The word „pointer“ is coming from the computer science, and means object, which stores a memory address .  The main idea of the project is the creative interpretation of the term „sound object“ (unit of sound, an acoustic action and intention of listening ), coined by P.Schaeffer. The extension of this versatile term via the gestural component defines the direction in which the duo is working in this project.  The movements of the dancer are unfolding and exploring the sound objects. Dance is being derived from realtime strategies of sound processing, and also the sound objects are being formed as a result of choreographic sequences, following the bidirectionality of interactive co-creation. In this project the memory (represented by the Ukrainian folksongs) is interpreted as a collective cultural subconsciousness .

Performances: ver. A - Salzburg 2022, ver. B - Graz 2022, ver. C - Eckernfoerde 2023.

Here is a short comparison between the snippets from the version A and version B.
