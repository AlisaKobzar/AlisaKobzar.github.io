title: Floating pointers (ver.D)
date: 2023-02-02

---


The „Floating pointers“ project exists in 4 versions, 3 of which have been already presented in different venues in Salzburg (A), Graz (B), and Eckernförde (C) (Provinzlärm Festival).

Version A explores the human-computer interaction methods with the dancer’s complete control of the sound medium, version B is focused on the human-to-human interaction as an alternative interpretation of the same computer music instruments. Version C combines both approaches and invites the audience to compare the beautiful and completely different results.

Currently developed version D, which is planned to be premiered fully during the Ultima festival in Oslo (September 2023), uses 8-channel electronic music and incorporates gesture recognition and an interactive machine learning mechanism, which analyses the results of HCI and HHI. Also, the multimedia performance is extended with the virtual world of sound objects’ contexts and references. The results of the ML process give suggestions for virtual camera systems in the virtual world of shattered memories.

The word „pointer“ comes from computer science and means an object, which stores a memory address. The main idea of the project is the creative interpretation of the term „sound object“, coined by P.Schaeffer. The extension of this versatile term via the gestural component defines the direction in which the duo is working in this project. The movements of the dancer are unfolding and exploring the sound objects. Dance is derived from real-time strategies of sound processing, and also the sound objects are formed as a result of choreographic sequences, following the bi-directionality of interactive co-creation. A simple machine learning algorithm is giving propositions on virtual and real storytelling development, analysing the previous gestural and auditory outputs of human-to-human interactions.
In this project, the memory is interpreted as a collective cultural subconsciousness with Ukrainian folksongs.

Premiere: [Ultima contemporary music festival 2023](https://www.ultima.no/en/ultima-2023) in Oslo (Norway)
