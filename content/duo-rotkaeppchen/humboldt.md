Live electronic music, live visual art, dance in front of the video projection.

Alexander von Humboldt (1769- 1859) is a german geographer, naturalist, explorer and the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change, in 1800 and again in 1831, based on observations generated during his travels. How could he react on the climate changes today?
In the piece „a letter to Humboldt“ we want to pay people’s attention to the beauty and at the same time vulnerability of the nature. 
The dancer’s awareness of the global visual content makes possible to explore not only the sound-dance, dance-sound, visuals-sound, sound - visuals , but also dance - visuals interaction. Working with the relatively small space during the performance, dancer explores the world and effects of the climate changes during the transformative journey, physically staying almost on the same place, which becomes visually persuasive because of using the multimedia means. Dancer is working with her own shadow as well as a creative tool and additional layer in the visual space.

The 2 version of "a letter to Humboldt" builds upon the mentioned concepts, and adds a climatological data, which within the performance time takes over the projections and distorts the visuals, trying to turn them into a visual noise.
