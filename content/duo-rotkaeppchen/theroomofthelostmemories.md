title: the room of the lost memories
date: 2023-02-02

Live performance with the active motion-tracking system, where the dancer interacts with the invisible objects and fully controls the sound.

Flashback into the space, where everything is questionably existing in the personal emotional relations with the memory-carrier. The memories come and go not always as expected, forcing the carrier to live them shortly again. There is no evidence how the memories are connected. The reality after flashback is not perceived in the same way.
