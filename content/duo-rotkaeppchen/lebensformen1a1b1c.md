This project explores the feedback connection between the inner and outer.

Initially planned as a project for 2 dancers and a e-violin performer (version 1), producing an effect on each other during the performance, because of the COVID-19 restrictions project has the live instrumental component.
Currently project exists in 4 versions. 
Version 1 explores the 3 elementary living forms, coexisting and sharing the multimedia and physical spaces. Version 1a is connecting the oscillations of one dancer between the inner and outer worlds as seen from the perspective of another dancer.  Version 1b is focused on the oscillations of one dancer between the inner and outer worlds.
Version 1c (currently in production phase) is a game-based virtualisation of the version 1.
