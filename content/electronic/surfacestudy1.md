„Surface studies“ is a series of compositions for 1-4 computer-music performers. It explores the physical touch of the electrically conductive parts of the hybridised score-instrument. The main sonic idea is based on a simple statement, that with the bare hands, one could share the body’s electrical properties to the auditory domain. The visual design of the score-instrument combines the affordances of the conductive paint with the drawn sound approach. The score-instrument is created as a visual art form in the relation to the graphic score concept. „Surface studies“ are questioning the aesthetic results of the improvisations with digital music instruments and tangible scores via the application of the traditional composer’s practice of score creation. „Surface study-1“ is a live-electronics composition for 1 or 2 computer-music performers.
